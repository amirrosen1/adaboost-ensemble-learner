# AdaBoost Ensemble Learner

This repository contains a Python implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm, using a decision stump as the weak learner. The AdaBoost model boosts a weak learner by iteratively improving its performance on misclassified examples, leading to a stronger classifier.

## Features
- AdaBoost model implementation based on a decision stump
- Generate synthetic datasets for binary classification
- Plot training and test error rates
- Visualize decision boundaries at different iterations
- Evaluate model performance with various noise levels
